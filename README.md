# reflectivecoder README

We've all experienced those moments where we've spent hours fleshing out a feature or just a block of code that we're proud of, only to come back the next day and wonder, 'Who wrote this?' (even though we know it was us). ReflectiveCoder is designed to gently remind you to reflect and journal after saving a file or closing out VS Code. Whether you maintain an engineering journal, as suggested, or prefer another form of journaling, that's up to you. Let this extension be your gentle nudge to capture those insights and experiences.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.


### 1.0.0

Initial release of ReflectiveCoder
